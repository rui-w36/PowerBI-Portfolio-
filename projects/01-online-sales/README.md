## 🎯 Business Objectives

The analysis addresses four key business questions:

1. What are the main drivers of revenue growth?
2. How is revenue distributed across customer segments?
3. Are there product portfolio optimization opportunities?
4. What is the impact of order cancellations on profitability?

## 📊 Key Findings

### 📈 Strong Seasonal Growth Dependency
Revenue is heavily concentrated between August and November, with November representing the annual peak. Business performance is strongly dependent on seasonal demand cycles.

### 👥 High Customer Revenue Concentration
The top 23.6% of customers generate over 65% of total revenue, revealing significant dependency on key accounts.

### 🏠 Product Portfolio Focused on Home Categories
Home Decor, Kitchen, and Household categories account for nearly 70% of total revenue, defining the company’s core business positioning.

### ❗ Operational Risk from Order Cancellations
The overall cancellation rate reaches 16%, particularly concentrated among high-value customers, creating hidden cost and margin risks.

### 🌍 Limited International Revenue Contribution
Over 84% of total revenue originates from the UK, indicating limited efficiency in international expansion.
